<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>
  Hello Reader, I am Kartikey Singh. Recently I had cleared Jee and waiting for the counselling
    process to start so that I can get admission in any NITs or IITs or any other government
    coleges .
    Lately in 2018-19, I love to click beautiful picture(according to me) at that time I love
    photography but due to limited time,I couldn't conquer that skill completely. I love to listen and
    mimiking raps songs,if I had to choose best Rapper in India, the I definetly choose <strong>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChDX4wagpTQS0aTm4eyhJaw">KRSNA</a></strong> from DNH GANG.
    I even try to learn the technicalities of rap music,
    but i dont give enough time to do that, now I have a lot of free time to learn any new skill, so I am
    learning both.
    Right now, my aim is to become world class coder and get internship ASAP, and also to write good songs like Krsna.
    Well, I think its enough to know me ,since I am little introvert and dont want to share the rest of my personal information.
    So, bye bye and have a good day.
